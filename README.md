# Lux: A Godot Game Template
Lux is a game template made for Godot (4.4). It includes a basic setup of commonly used features, so that starting a new project is much quicker. Features include:

- Camera

## Usage
Anyone is free to use this template. I made it for personal use, so it will not be updated regularly. Keep in mind that if the engine updates, the template may be out of date. The current version was made for Godot 4.4.

To use the template:

2. Create a new project in Godot for your game
